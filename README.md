# SPEECH-EMOTION-RECOGNITION
## Introduction
Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) is the process of trying to recognise human emotion and effective states from speech. Speech emotion recognition is a very interesting yet very challenging task of human computer interaction. In recent years this topic has grabbed so much attention. In the field of speech emotion recognition many techniques have been utilized to extract emotions from signals, including many wellestablished speech analysis and classification techniques. In the traditional way of speech emotion recognition features are extracted from the speech signals and then the features are selected which is collectively known as a selection module and then the emotions are recognized. This is a very lengthy and time taking process so this project gives an overview of the machine learning technique which is based on a simple algorithm based on feature extraction and model creation which recognizes the emotion.
